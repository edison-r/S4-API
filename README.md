# 🐾 SPRINT 4 – APIs, Weather & Fun Cat Facts

This is a front-end project focused on working with **multiple APIs**, curating their data, and building an engaging user interface.  
It was made as part of my learning journey and helped me **connect external data with meaningful UX/UI**.

## APIs Used

- [Meow Facts](https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/) – fun cat trivia  
- [Dog Facts](https://dogapi.dog/) – to alternate facts  
- [Cataas API](https://cataas.com/#/) – random cat images  
- [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) – local weather forecast  

All API calls are **centralized and modularized** to keep things scalable.

## Technologies

- HTML5 + TailwindCSS (v4)
- TypeScript
- Modular JavaScript (ESModules)
- Geolocation API (to detect your position)
- Mobile-first UX/UI

## Main Features

### Cat Facts & Images

- On every interaction (like/dislike), the app fetches a **new fact and image**.
- The data is randomized between cats and dogs.
- Uses a **buffer queue** to preload and render quickly.
  
*Posible Next-steps:*
- With the buffer queue, render more image cards behind the current one and animate them using `z-index`.
- Implementing swipe gestures (left/right) fot like/dislike actions - similar to Tinder UX.

### Weather Info

- On page load, your geolocation is requested.
- If accepted, weather is shown for your position.
- If denied, it defaults to **Barcelona**.
- Data includes: temperature, UV index, and rain probability.

*Posible Next-steps:*
- Animate with scroll to allways show the current weather icon and temperature.
- Create smart tips depending on the weather (UV index, rain, etc) e.g:
  *"Right now, the UV index is higher than 6! Take care and put some sunscreen"*

### Like / Dislike

- You can rate each fact.
- A smooth animation dissolves the current card before the next one appears.

*Posible Next-steps:*
- Animate the cards with swipe gesture.
- Create a **top-5 most liked facts** view.

## Possible Improvements

- Add a real **top 5 liked facts** view.
- Improve image preloading logic for smoother transitions.
- Implement dark mode toggle fully.
- Enhance animations with GSAP or Framer Motion.
- Add language switch (EN/ES).

## Next Steps

This is just **version 1** of something much bigger I have in mind.
The long-term goal is to turn this into a small **adoption portal** — a friendly space where people can:

- Discover adoptable animals from **local shelters in Barcelona and nearby areas**.
- Learn fun facts and care tips about cats and dogs.
- Get updated weather info to plan walks or adoption events.
- Support local shelters and associations through visibility and donations.

This first version was mostly a playground to experiment with APIs and UX decisions, but in the future I want to connect it with **real data from local animal shelters**.
The project has the potential to grow into something useful and impactful — not just a dev exercise, but a tool that helps animals find a forever home. ❤️‍🩹🐱🐶

## My Dev Journal

This project was the most **modular** and “clean” one I’ve built so far.

In my first version, I had all the API calls somewhat organized, but not in the most efficient way — everything was kind of mixed together.
Later, my mentor helped me see how I could refactor the code: separating concerns properly and making the API access more agnostic. That led to a cleaner, modular structure where each service handles just one responsibility, and everything flows much better now.

Also, this was my **first time using TypeScript**. Having types helped me catch mistakes early and made me feel more confident in my logic.

One of the things I enjoyed the most was thinking about **performance** and **UX**. For example:  

Overall, this sprint reminded me that building something nice isn't just about code — it's about **crafting the experience!**.
